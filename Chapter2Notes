--We learned about how to create an Object from a Class. For example, if we want to create a Person object like an actual human being from the person class, we would have to initialize it by creating
an Object. For example, John = Person() would create an Object of the Person class. Now, since a person has to be defined by their own attributes like name, age, etc, we can do that by
John.name = "John"
John.age = 24.
By doing this, we are instantiating the Object by adding the given information.

-- We also learned about __init__ which is an easier way of creating objects from classes as it contains parameters that are passed from arguments easily
when creating the object and it would automatically store the given information into an Object.

-- __str__ controls how our object looks when printed as well as __repr__. For example str would print the name of an object within the parenthesis in our given method and print statement.
Repr is more of a technical version of printing objects. For example d = Apple('Bob') would print as Apple Bob.

-- We eventually learned about class and method overriding. For example:
class Animal:
def speak(self)
print(animal sound)

This code would print the animal sound but if we create an animal object, for e.g Dog(Animal) and print a different animal sound,
this is known as method overriding and would print the sound of the chosen animal of the same class and calling the same method using different variable.
